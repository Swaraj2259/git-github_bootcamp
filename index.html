    <h1>Git Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code.</p>
    <p>It is a powerful tool that can help you collaborate with others and keep track of your code history.</p>
    <p>With Git, you can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
    <p>When you are ready, you can merge your changes back into the main codebase.</p>
    <p>Git also allows you to revert to previous versions of your code if something goes wrong.</p>
    <p>It is a valuable skill for any developer to have, so let's get started!</p>
